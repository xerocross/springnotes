# springnotes

Springnotes is a text-based note-keeping API built in Java
using Spring Boot and Spring Security for authentication.

Essentially the idea is just to be able to store bits of
arbitrary text for later retrieval. The purpose of this is
mainly to practice using Spring Boot, Hibernate, Spring
Security, and making REST APIs.
